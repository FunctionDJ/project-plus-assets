Project N logo by waffeln/Function: (missing from repo)
Description: Basically the same as v1, but a "N" character instead.
Lore: "Project N" was the initial name before the dev team made a poll for a better name, which became "Project+".

P+ logo v1 by waffeln/Function:
Description: blue paintbrush "+" with white and black outlines and a scanline texture, inspired by original Project M 3.6's logo "M" style

P+ logo v2 by Neuromancer:
Description: Style inspired by the "Project" part of the PM 3.6 logo.
White "P" and orange "+" with sharp, black stroke.
The "+" has an orange fill with a very light scanline texture.
The "+" also has a scanline-textured, blueish, and sharp 'drop-shadow'.
Lore: It was probably the team that wasn't quite satisfied with v1, maybe the community also didn't like it too much, but a logo contest was held and Neuromancer's logo won and became v2.

P+ logo v3 by Neuromancer, modified by waffeln/Function:

Description: same as v2, but the "+" has a teal gradient fill.

Variations:
• with v2's 'drop-shadow'
• without the 'drop-shadow'. Generally for small sizes.
• with v2's 'drop-shadow', and a more pronounced scanline texture and less saturation (more teal) for the "+" fill. Generally for big sizes.

Lore: waffeln/Function modified P+ v2 logo with a green/teal tint for the private developer Discord to differentiate it from the public Project+ Discord, which had the original logo with the orange plus.
The team liked the green/teal one so much that it became the official logo with some modifications (see variations) before official release and is still the official logo at time of writing (February 2021).
Since both Discord logos would be the same (except that the public Discord's v3 logo is animated), the current developer Discord's logo is the v3 logo - just upside down.
